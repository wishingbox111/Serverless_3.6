# Serverless_3.6
Amazon API gateway and Lambda


## Assignment for 3.6


### Brief

To familiarize you with using the tools that we have learned before, this is the assignment that we will do in this module.

Provision:

1. Create a new repository with the following name conventions:
`serverless-app-` or any other names.
2. Create a new serverless application and push all the code in the new repository you created. (note that lambda application is a group of lambda functions, and we've deployed functions, hence we consider the same for this assignment. Application might be able to have more functions like add a prefix to the group of lambda names....)
3. You can create any serverless code example or default code example.
4. Dont forget change the name in the `readme.md` if necessary
5. Make sure the repository is publicly accessible.
6. Submit the repository link on BlackBoard.

### Submission 

- Submit the URL of the GitHub Repository that contains your work to NTU black board.
- Should you reference the work of your classmate(s) or online resources, give them credit by adding either the name of your classmate or URL.
